MedCamp Health Camp Analysis

Overview MedCamp is a not-for-profit organization aimed at improving the health conditions of working professionals. By organizing health camps in cities with low work-life balance, MedCamp strives to promote awareness, offer medical tests, and ultimately encourage healthier lifestyles.

The organization has conducted 65 health camps over the past 4 years, accumulating data on approximately 110,000 registrations. This project focuses on predicting the probability of achieving a favorable outcome at these camps, helping optimize inventory and improve participant experience.

Objectives Predict Favorable Outcomes:

For camp formats 1 and 2: A favorable outcome is defined as participants receiving a health score. For camp format 3: A favorable outcome is defined as participants visiting at least one awareness stall.

Optimize Inventory Management:

Prevent overstocking, which incurs high costs. Avoid understocking, which leads to poor participant experience. Analyze Participant Behavior:

Understand the drop-off between registration and attendance. Derive insights into factors influencing participation. Process Flow Registration: MedCamp employees and volunteers drive registrations by reaching out to working professionals. Some registration data is incomplete due to hardware failures.

Camp Participation:

Participants either undergo medical tests or visit awareness stalls, depending on the camp format. Outcomes are recorded based on participant actions.

Camp Formats:

Format 1 & 2: Instantaneous health scores are provided. Format 3: Awareness stalls are organized to educate participants about various health issues.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes: Registration Data: Records of individuals who registered for the health camps. Participation Data: Information on whether registered individuals attended the camps and their actions during the events. Camp Formats: The type of health camp organized (1, 2, or 3).

Other Details:

Limited profile information about participants. Missing data for registration dates and times for certain camps.

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python Libraries: Data manipulation: pandas, numpy Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn Machine Learning: scikit-learn Imbalanced Data Handling: imblearn (e.g., SMOTE)

Steps to Solve the Problem

Data Preprocessing:Clean and handle missing or incomplete data. Convert categorical data into numerical format. Address imbalances in the dataset using SMOTE or similar techniques.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Understand trends in registration and participation over time. Analyze factors affecting drop-offs and favorable outcomes. Visualize patterns in attendance based on camp formats and demographics.

Feature Engineering: Generate meaningful features, such as registration-to-camp intervals or participation trends.

Model Building: Train classification models to predict the probability of favorable outcomes. Validate models using cross-validation techniques.

Optimization: Use predictions to optimize inventory levels for future camps.

Challenges and Considerations Limited participant profile information requires creative feature engineering. Missing registration data must be addressed for accurate predictions. Balancing inventory optimization with participant satisfaction is critical.

Conclusion This project provides actionable insights into participant behavior and equips MedCamp with tools to optimize inventory, improve participant experience, and enhance the overall efficiency of their health camps.
